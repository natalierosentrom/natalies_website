<h1>Little Lady Lamp</h1>
<img src="school stuff/Lamp Project/LampBrainstorm.png">
<p>This was my original concept idea. I wanted to go off of a typical lampshade shape and make a dress. For the stand, I thought it would be cute to have cheeky little underwear under the dress. </p>

<p>Upon further development, I realized that to make a smooth cone shape like how I originally wanted would be too hard to make out of cardboard. I altered the design to be a series of increasing rings that fit into .5in. slots on vertical pieces. These would also help hold up the legs. </p>

<p>This was the future rendering with color that I made in Procreate and then this was my final poster:</p>
