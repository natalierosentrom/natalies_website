    <h1>Thinking Outside The Cube: Creating Cubette</h1>

    <b>Time:</b> five weeks, 2023 (sophomore) <br>
    <b>Role:</b> designer, fabricator <br>
    <b>Objectives:</b> <br>
    +All materials used from recycled woods or found objects within 16 x 16 x 16" space <br>
        +Acquire a basic working knowledge of hand tools & machines <br>
        +Understanding of joinery & construction terms <br>
        +Explore the visual relationships between design, media, audience and message.
        <p>The objective for the cube project was to create a 16 x 16 x 16 “implied” cube, meaning that it should loosely represent the form of a cube. 
        By using three different kinds of joinery, the goal was to get familiar with crafting and fabricating with wood. </p>
        <p>Through brainstorming I landed on the idea of figuring out a 3-way lap joint, having the x, y, and z-axis overlap together centrally, 
            with the endings of each axis being constructed slightly differently to give a broader understanding of carpentry. </p>
        <p>Originally I was completely unsure of how to make this 3-way lap joint work. I knew how to do it with two axis but the challenge was fitting the third axis altogether. 
            After So Much sketching and talking to my peers, I was able to construct a small model for how the three pieces would come together. 
            Two anchor pieces and the “key” piece that would turn into place. </p>
