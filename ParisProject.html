    <h1>Redesigning The Paris 2024 Olympics</h1>


    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-01 copy.png">
    <p>Over the course of 8 weeks the Olympics Project required that we chose an olympic Games
        to rebrand with a logo, three posters, and a third element of our choosing. This is my redesign 
        of the Paris 2024 Olympics to celebrate the centenial of 100 years ago: Paris 1924 Olympic Games.
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-04 copy.png">
    <p> Through research I discovered that Paris was also the home to 
        the 1924 Olympic Games, making the 2024 Olympics the 100 year anniversary!
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-02 copy.png">
    <p>100 years ago at the 1920s Oympics, Paris was the first olympics to have a 
        radio broadcast, the first time that women players were admitted and the home 
        to the first Olympic Village. These will be the topic for my three posters later on.
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-03 copy.png">
    <p> My audience for this project is women (celebrating 100 year anniversary of women in the olympic games) and 
        those with childike whimsy, simiar to myself. 
    </p>
    
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-05 copy.png">
    <p> Some of my early visual direction included gingham, pastels, and inky pen drawing to emulate the aesthetic 
        of paris that I was trying to currate. 
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-06 copy.png">
    <p> Pictured above is the official Paris 2024 Logo. I am not a fan personally but we will come back to this logo 
        in one of my posters.
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-07 copy.png">
    <p> I started brainstorming some designs and fonts that I liked for the logo. I knew that I wanted 
        the logo to be handwritten and have a parisian feel. These are some of the sketches I drew up using pen and 
        ink. This lampost worked perfect for the stem of the P.
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-08 copy.png">
    <p>This is my final logo, incorporating the P into the Olympic rings.</p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-09 copy.png">
    <p> Continuing with this style of pen and ink I wanted to create my own font for this project. I used a website 
        called "Calligraphr" to digitize the font so that I could type it right into my designs in Illustrator. 
    </p>
    
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-10 copy.jpg">
    <p>After the logo came designing the posters, here they are all together but I will go in depth of each of them.</p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-11 copy.png">
    <p>First off was the poster to celebrate "100 years of Radio Media Coverage at the Paris Olympics". I wanted this poster 
        to have an Art Nouveau feel with the boarder and format of the poster. I chose to include a victrola to add to the 20's feel
        of the poster. 
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-12 copy.png">
    <p>The second poster was to celebrate the anniversary of women players in the olympic games. Taking inspiration
        from the official logo, I liked the notion of a lady with fire hair but not in a circle. I experimented with taking 
        her out of the circle and extending her hair and messing around with her hair in a way that could accomidate the 
        location of the rings in the logo. Through my research early on I found this stamp from the 1924 olympic games and 
        thought it could be cool to pull in some elements from it. I swapped out the "25 postes france" for a "24 Paris France" 
        to include the 24 of 2024, additionally borrowing the boader format of the stamp. 
    </p>

    <p> The final poster was for the Olympic Village. This design was a bit of a fight. I knew I wanted to include houses 
        and architecture of paris but I couldn't figure out the composition until I leaned on my early sketch of inky houses
        that I knew I wanted to build off of a city landscape.  
    </p>
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-14 copy.png">
    <p> For the third part of the assignment I made the bold choice to screenprint my olympic village poster with 
        five different colors. With help from the print lab I made printed out
