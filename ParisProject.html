<h1>Redesigning The Paris 2024 Olympics</h1>
<div class="paris">
    <img src="school stuff/Paris Project/ParisFinalPresentationSlides-01 copy.png">
    <p>Over the course of __ weeks the Olympics Project required that we chose an olympic Games
        to rebrand with a logo, three posters, and a third element of our choosing. This is my redesign 
        of the Paris 2024 Olympics to celebrate the centenial of 100 years ago: Paris 1924 Olympic Games.
    </p>

    <p> Through research I discovered that Paris was also the home to 
        the 1924 Olympic Games, making the 2024 Olympics the 100 year anniversary!
    </p>

    <p>100 years ago at the 1920s Oympics, Paris was the first olympics to have a 
        radio broadcast, the first time that women players were admitted and the home 
        to the first Olympic Village. These will be the topic for my three posters later on.
    </p>

    <p> My audience for this project is women (celebrating 100 year anniversary of women in the olympic games) and 
        those with childike whimsy, simiar to myself. 
    </p>

    <p> Some of my early visual direction included gingham, pastels, and inky pen drawing to emulate the aesthetic 
        of paris that I was trying to currate.

    <p> Pictured above is the official Paris 2024 Logo. I am not a fan personally.</p>

    <p> I started brainstorming some designs and fonts that I liked for the logo. I knew that I wanted 
        the logo to be handwritten and have a parisian feel. These are some of the sketches I drew up using pen and 
        ink. This lampost worked perfect for the stem of the P.

    <p>This is my final logo, incorporating the P into the Olympic rings.</p>
