<p>Okay, so another day working on the website, I got the background image in there. I might format it in a different way, but that can happen later. I want to do some different logos and things for buttons. The ones that I have in there now are not swangin. I want them to be swangin. 
I also need to figure out how to make these texts more readable. I have so many ideas that I want to execute but it takes SO LONG TO LEARN. Alas, I am intelligent and resilient and i love ChatGPT!!!! mvp right there. This is what my home page looks like right now:

<p>I'm learning how to code in html and css right now, and its just so super hard. I have so many ideas that I want to do, but its just so difficult and i keep getting stuck. But I know how to display text, so I'll write here and update with website things.

    I have wanted a blog for a long time. I want to have everything in one place. I have checked out other bloggy websites, but this way I can own the stuff that I put out. HOWEVER. that also means that I am the one that has to learn how to code. (agony)
