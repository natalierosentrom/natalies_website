<h2>My journey to coding a website in HMTL and CSS:</h2>

<h3>August 6,2023</h3>
<p>I went to the library today to make sure that I got stuff done today. I worked on the captains log portion. 
    I couldn't figure out how to caption the image and have the caption be right under the picture when it was flexed to the right so I just gave up 
    on that part. I also added the "back to home" button so now you can navigate the site. It makes it feel so much more real and 
    like an actual website. 
    <br>
    I spent ten minutes trying to figure out how to center a unicorn gif at the bottom of the home screen. so glad that I got there. It looks awesome. 

</p>

<h3>July 23, 2023</h3>
<p>Dude. I have been coding all day long. I took adderall this morning bc i was feeling like ive done nothing recently 
    and i totally just worked on this website all day long. I did the buttons, i did the home sceen, the three column jazz 
    on modelingportfolio.html. that shit was actually so hard. like a full days work on figuring out how the hell to whip and 
    nae nae on those div tags. flex box. 
    I am so proud of today! I am getting closer to feeling like I can show my friends and share it wooohoooo!!1!!!1

    Brother trevor came by the other day and fixed the issue with not being able to push it, so now its all fixed and ready to go


</p>

<h3>July 8, 2023</h3>
<p>I've been on a roll today! I put all my sketchbook scans in a #TwoColumnGallery isn't that awesome??? 
    Look at me go! I don't know how to update the website and commit it, I'll have to have Trevor help me with that one tomorrow. 
    But I did so much today! This project is so good bc it's also allowing me to do stuff in photoshop, and also like file manage all nice like.
    It's so important to name your stuff! Also, the fact that like every file has to be in the right folder in the right place for the computer to read it. 
    I mean it makes sense but it's also cool to learn that the computer will do only what you want it to do when you tell it just the right thing. 
</p>


<h3>June 22, 2023</h3> 
<p>Okay, so another day working on the website, I got the background image in there. I might format it in a different way, but that can happen later. I want to do some different logos and things for buttons. 
    The ones that I have in there now are not swangin. I want them to be SWANGIN.
I also need to figure out how to make these texts more readable. I have so many ideas that I want to execute but it takes SO LONG TO LEARN. Alas, I am intelligent and resilient and i love ChatGPT!!!! mvp right there. This is what my home page looks like right now:

<img style="height: 140px" class="homepageupdate1" src="images/homepageupdate1.png">
<p>not too great but it's a start!</p>

<h3> June 21, 2023</h3>
<p>I'm learning how to code in html and css right now, and its just so super hard. I have so many ideas that I want to do, but its just so difficult and i keep getting stuck. But I know how to display text, so I'll write here and update with website things. 
    <br>
    I have wanted a blog for a long time. I want to have everything in one place. I have checked out other bloggy websites, but this way I can own the stuff that I put out. HOWEVER. that also means that I am the one that has to learn how to code. (agony)
