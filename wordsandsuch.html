        I am in Buffalo New York as of current and I just made a whole blog post. 
        I think this will be a nice format to work in going forward. 
        I am using Figma and Photoshop to resize everything. I am happy with how it is looking. 
        It will also be nice to have a format for future posts as well.

    <p> 
        I added a soundboard to the website today. I followed a youtube video about JavaScript and workshopped it in there. 
        I originally wanted it to be on the homepage but the audio tag wouldn't work with div blocks so I just made it into 
        a seperate html file and then styles just the whole body tag. <br>
        I have ALWAYS wanted a soundboard and this feels amazing to have it set in place now. It took over an hour to get the 
        "bruh" button to work but once I got it to run i was SO EXCITED. So now I can just put any mp3 in there. This is a 
        FANTASTIC developmental acheivement for me. It was my first time working with JavaScript and oh man! I dont get it! 
        What the fuck is a function!!! IDK!!! But I'll learn as time goes on. <br>
        I also changed the background on a lot of pages and styled some of the buttons to make everything prettier. 
        I am excited about my work I did today and I am proud of myself for figuring out audio and getting a soundboard to work.
        SO SO HAPPY GANG YAYAYAYAYAY!!!!

    <p> I have been messing around with fixing the bugs and getting everything respondsive so that 
        it doesnt look like complete dookie poo on iphone. I dont know what my plans for this site is 
        at this current point in time. Do I want to share all my shiz? I dunno what I should put here 
        and what I should put in my book. Some of the words I have are like too #poetic and #gay and #emo to
        put on a website, but I feel like it could fly in a book format. But am I working on that? dont be silly. 
        <br>
        What could I write about in a blog? Perhaps something will strike me and I'll want to put it 
        here. Until then, I'm doing bug fixes and making everything run smoother. 
        You have to work hard to make things happen? #annoying.

    <p>Boooooooooo!!! I have not worked on this website at ALL DUDE. And i miss it!! I have so many ideas
        that I want to actualize but i just have ZERO TIME and it blows chunks. Everyday I contimplate just 
        paying for an already made website. I just have to wait till I have more time (sobs)</p>

    </p>

    <h3>September 8,2023</h3>
    <p>Now that I am back in school (start of Junior Year) I plan to work more on this project.
        These are the things that I'm noticing currently that I want to add:<br>
        -Navigation Bar <br>
        -Fixing the instagram and email logo,, finding the placement for those <br>
        -Making all the htmls work with different media size (make sure its nice on iphone)<br>
        -Making the home page nice a perty<br>
        -Actually getting some school stuff in there/finding a method of display that formats my work nicely with words<br>
    </p>

    <p>UUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>

    <h3>August 6,2023</h3>
    <p>I went to the library today to make sure that I got stuff done today. I worked on the captains log portion. 
        I couldn't figure out how to caption the image and have the caption be right under the picture when it was flexed to the right so I just gave up 
        on that part. I also added the "back to home" button so now you can navigate the site. It makes it feel so much more real and 
        like an actual website. 
        <br>
        I spent ten minutes trying to figure out how to center a unicorn gif at the bottom of the home screen. so glad that I got there. It looks awesome. 

    </p>

    <h3>July 23, 2023</h3>
    <p>Dude. I have been coding all day long. I took adderall this morning bc i was feeling like ive done nothing recently 
        and i totally just worked on this website all day long. I did the buttons, i did the home sceen, the three column jazz 
        on modelingportfolio.html. that shit was actually so hard. like a full days work on figuring out how the hell to whip and 
        nae nae on those div tags. flex box. 
        I am so proud of today! I am getting closer to feeling like I can show my friends and share it wooohoooo!!1!!!1

        Brother trevor came by the other day and fixed the issue with not being able to push it, so now its all fixed and ready to go


    </p>

    <h3>July 8, 2023</h3>
    <p>I've been on a roll today! I put all my sketchbook scans in a #TwoColumnGallery isn't that awesome??? 
        Look at me go! I don't know how to update the website and commit it, I'll have to have Trevor help me with that one tomorrow. 
        But I did so much today! This project is so good bc it's also allowing me to do stuff in photoshop, and also like file manage all nice like.
        It's so important to name your stuff! Also, the fact that like every file has to be in the right folder in the right place for the computer to read it. 
        I mean it makes sense but it's also cool to learn that the computer will do only what you want it to do when you tell it just the right thing. 
    </p>


    <h3>June 22, 2023</h3> 
    <p>Okay, so another day working on the website, I got the background image in there. I might format it in a different way, but that can happen later. I want to do some different logos and things for buttons. 
        The ones that I have in there now are not swangin. I want them to be SWANGIN.
    I also need to figure out how to make these texts more readable. I have so many ideas that I want to execute but it takes SO LONG TO LEARN. Alas, I am intelligent and resilient and i love ChatGPT!!!! mvp right there. This is what my home page looks like right now:
    </p>
    <img style="height: 140px" class="homepageupdate1" src="images/homepageupdate1.png">
    <p>not too great but it's a start!</p>

    <h3> June 21, 2023</h3>
    <p>I'm learning how to code in html and css right now, and its just so super hard. I have so many ideas that I want to do, but its just so difficult and i keep getting stuck. But I know how to display text, so I'll write here and update with website things. 
        <br>
        I have wanted a blog for a long time. I want to have everything in one place. I have checked out other bloggy websites, but this way I can own the stuff that I put out. HOWEVER. that also means that I am the one that has to learn how to code. (agony)
